#Question and Answer App With React

A project to try out react.js (in this app used coffeescript because of familiarity, may change later). Current commit supports:
- Add question
- display all questions asked with:
 - answer count and view count
 - highest voted answer value
 - date submitted
- Hacky suggestion for previously asked questions
- Answer questions on individual pages
 - vote on answers
 - date time submitted
 
## ToDo:
- users and authentication (allow anonymous use, but require login for features)
- fix suggestion method
- prevent vote manipulation (one vote per user / ip)
- give answers unique urls
- style and cleanup (date formatting and css)
